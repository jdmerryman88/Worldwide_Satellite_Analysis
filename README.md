# Worldwide_Satellite_Analysis

Have you ever wondered about all the satellites circling the Earth? Satellites are used for a variety of reasons in our everyday lives. Some are used to provide you television services, others are used for the GPS navigation, and then others are used for satellite phone communication. Then of course are all the satellites used by governments around the world for military purposes. 

In this program we will go through a collection to answer various questions about the satellites currently orbiting the Earth. The data used for this analysis came from the Union of Concerned Scientist. And can be found at https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/satellite-database . 

Analysis of the current 2,787 satellites orbiting Earth will be completed to answer the following questions. 

How many satellites does a given country have in orbit, and what are they used for?
How many satellites are used for military purposes versus commercial purposes?
Which countries have earth-observing satellites?
When was the oldest working satellite launched?
At what altitudes do most satellites orbit?
What activities are most satellites involved with?
Where are the most launch sites?
How many satellites are launched per year?
Launches per contractor for the top 10 Contractors worldwide?

This project was completed by Justin Merryman, Tamey Washington, Raven Washington.
